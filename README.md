# algolia-tedtalks-demo

Demonstration of Algolia using TEDTalks data (speakers, talks, and playlists).

## Process

1. Set up Node scaffolding and app structure.
2. Create `loader.js` to load records via API (already have experience doing that via dashboard).
3. Create `index.js` to initialize Algolia Instantsearch and required widgets for UI.
4. Create `index.html` to provide UI scaffolding for displaying the results of Instantsearch.
5. Project cleanup and documentation.
